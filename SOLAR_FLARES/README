The file xray.txt contains five columns
Year Month Day Hour Minute
that correspond to the start time of a solar flare.

xray.txt was created by prep.m, which parses the files xray200*
obtained from NOAA/NGDC.

The file compute.m creates an array with elements of number of events
per day. If using IDL, you will need to create a function that does
this.
